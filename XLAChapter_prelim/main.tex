\section*{Learning Outcomes}
After completing this chapter, students should be able to do the following.
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform basic operations, including addition, scalar multiplication and dot product on vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
    \item Perform basic operations, including addition and scalar multiplication, on geometric representations of vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
    \item Transition seamlessly between algebraic and geometric representations of vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
   \item  Determine the angle between vectors and test for orthogonality.

   \item  Project one vector onto another.

   \item  Compute the cross product of two vectors in $\RR^3$, and explain what it is they computed.

   \item Transition seamlessly between parametric and non-parametric forms of the equation of a line in $\RR^2$.
   
   \item Transition seamlessly between parametric and vector forms of the equation of a line in $\RR^2$ or $\RR^3$.

   \item  Determine the equation of a plane in $\RR^3$ meeting given characteristics.
   
 \end{itemize}

\section*{Learning Outcomes}
After completing this chapter, students should be able to do the following.
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Interpret a matrix as a linear transformation from $\RR^n$ to $\RR^m$.
    \item Produce a matrix representation of a linear transformation given its action on the standard unit vectors.
    \item Identify some basic geometric transformations in the plane.
    \item Discuss the transformation’s kernel and image in terms of nullity and rank of the matrix.
    \item Give examples of linear transformations that are invertible or not invertible.
    \item  Interpret a matrix product as a composition of linear transformations.
 
\end{itemize}

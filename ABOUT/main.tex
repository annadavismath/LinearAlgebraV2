\subsection{About this Text}
This is the second edition of An Interactive Introduction to Linear Algebra.  The \href{https://ximera.osu.edu/la/LinearAlgebra}{first edition} was funded by the Ohio Open Ed Collaborative (OOEC) through the Ohio Department of Higher Education Innovation grant. 

This edition contains significant updates to content as well as integration of GeoGebra interactives throughout the narrative.

These materials satisfy the Ohio Transfer Module TAG Guidelines for a first course in Linear Algebra.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
\begin{itemize}
\item
We would like to thank our reviewers Jim Fowler of Ohio State University and Jim Cottrill of Ohio Dominican University for their thoughtful comments and suggestions regarding the first edition.  
\item This project would not have been possible without the XIMERA platform.  Many thanks go to Bart Snapp and Jim Fowler of Ohio State University for their continued guidance and support.   
\item We are grateful to the Ohio Open Ed Collaborative and the Ohio Department of Higher Education for providing initial funding for this project, and to Ohio Dominican University and Lakeland Community College for supporting us through sabbatical leaves.
\item Our inspiration and some of our content came from other open textbooks. We would like to thank Keith Nicholson and Ken Kuttler for making their texts available under a Creative Commons license.  Since one of the authors taught Linear Algebra using the excellent book by David Poole for fifteen years, that text has most certainly influenced our work as well.
